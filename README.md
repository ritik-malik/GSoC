## Project Abstract

The aim of the CHAOSS community is to create analytics and metrics to help define the community health. And it is the reports that play the presentation part of any organization, giving a good overview of the whole community. These reports (in the form of metric release), communicate the information which has been compiled as a result of research and analysis of all the metrics defined so far.

Improving the metric release process and fully automating will not only save time, but it will also help us to define a central structure for the current as well as upcoming WGs/metrics. Keeping in mind the ever evolving CHAOSS, the process would be scalable and flexible enough for easy tweaking in future. The quality and the impression of the PDF would also be on equal priority.

Once the automatic metric release is implemented, we can extend this idea to automate the error handling and structuring of Working Groups and metrics. We can also automate the making of a new working group from a template rather than from scratch. We can try to get rid of typos and grammatical errors once and for all by including scripts for automated timely scanning and fixing of the working groups. A major chunk of these ideas will be decided by the community feedback.
